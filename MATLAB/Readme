orthoclust_2species.m	MATLAB code that optimizes the cost function of OrthoClust. It contains a function performing simulated annealing and an alternate function based on steepest descent. enter "help orthoclust_2species" in the matlab command line for details. 

./Data/worm_fly_networks_info.mat	contains the co-expression networks of worm, and fly and the list of worm-fly orthologs. all indexed by wormbase and flybase IDs
./3rd_party_code contains 3rd party code used

Example:
load ./Data/worm_fly_networks_info.mat;
kappa=3;
method=1;
clusters=orthoclust_2species(Aw,Af,orthologs23,kappa,method)
